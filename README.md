Supervised Feature Selection in Anomalous Pattern Detection

Developed an automated feature selection technique by aggregating several state-of the art feature selection methods
such as: Filters, Wrappers and embedded methods employing the ensemble technique in order to help the clinicians for
identifying the patterns of in-hospital mortality after ICU admission

Implemented different classification approaches namely Logistic Regression, K-nearest neighbours, Decision Tree, Support
Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network

Evaluated the model utilizing a confusion matrix, Precision, Recall, Specificity and F1 score and observed that Random
Forest classifier outperformed with 0.962 F1 score

Tech: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, Keras, Python, Artificial Neural network, Jupyter Notebook
